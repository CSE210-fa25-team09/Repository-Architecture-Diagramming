- **Facilitator:** Hayden Kwok
- **Attendees:** Elaine Chao, Andrew Zhou, Peter Tu, Jason Zhu, Srikrishna Dantu, Manav Ranawat

## What Went Well (Keep Doing) 🌟
- Team Structure
  - Splitting into 3 cross-functioning subteams has allowed for more concentrated production instead of cowboy-esk coding.
  - Subteam leads have done stellar jobs managing their groups as well as being proactive to collaborate with other leads and members.
  - This structure has allowed for the web app to be iterated at a more hastened and efficient pace.
- Positive morale and overall strong communication
  - By having a collective sense of proactivity and responibility, members have gone above and beyond than just their assigned tickets and contributed to the overall discussion of the process itself.
  - Communication on slack has been strong: sharing PRs for review, discussing trade-offs, and understanding priorities.
- Strong documentation and good Software Development practices
  - The above has allowed for fault-tolerant decision making and not having to be overly cautious in terms of our Architectural decisions.
  - By scaling up from a low-level of complexity, coupled with tracable decisions, the software has grown quickly and intelligently without needing to sacrifice much in return.

## What Didn't Go Well (Stop Doing) 🛑
- Attendance
  - Due to personal situations and workload, attendance has been inconsistent and has led to a lot of lost information from being shared.
  - Without a proactive mindset from all members, it is very easy to forget about documentation that has been posted and resort to loading subleads with work.
- Hard to be on the same page
  - Because of the above, as well as the fact that response times vary, it reduces the scope of the overall project and forces tickets into the next sprint.

## What Could Be Improved (Start Doing/Action Items) 🚀
- Have better structured meetings and project board
  - Our standups have been rather messy and seems more like an open discussion than a structured process. By creating stronger structure, that gives time for everyone to give updates and leads to synch it can bridge a lot of the gaps that are left in the slack channels. 
  - Additionally, the project board can be better cleaned up with more accurate dates and reduction of duplicated tickets by linking PRs to issues.
- Encourage proactivity with Story points and attendance tracking
  - By tracing the impact that each member contributes and leaving trails of documentation of such, team members will have a higher sense of responsibility to ensure that they meet the minimum criteria of their work.
